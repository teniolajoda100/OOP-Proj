Week1: (College Week 7)
We made the strategic decision to utilize Processing along with either the Minim library 
or the Processing Sound library. 
Main goal: Analyze the audio tracks of songs, focusing on extracting key characteristics 
such as: 


1.frequency
2.volume 

This foundational step will enable us to create an engaging music visualization in Java.


Week 2: (College Week8) 
 Using our audio analysis Week 1, we are set to develop visual elements designed to interact with the audio in real-time. Our approach is to embrace abstraction through visuals.

 Main goal: Create visuals that dynamically respond to music, aiming to visually represent
 
 1.Mood 
 2.Tempo
 3.Narrative

 Should result in an experience that tells a story and conveys emotions.

 Week 3: (College Week 9)
 This week focuses on using exciting visual version of the song.

Main goal: Use visuals to show the feelings, themes, and layout of the song, with a focus on:

1.Colour:Bright colours for happy parts and darker colours for sad or intense parts.

2.Shape: Different shapes to represent parts of the song. Sharp shapes for exciting parts, and smooth shapes for calm parts.

3.Motion: Make the visuals move in a way that follows the beat and rhythm of the song. Fast movements for fast parts of the song, and slow movements for the slow parts.

4.Composition: Arrange the visual elements in a way that shows the structure of the song, e.g using the layout to differentiate between the chorus and verses.

By doing this, we hope to make a visual story that goes along with the song.
