Week1: (College Week 7)
We made the decision to utilize Processing along with either the Minim library 
or the Processing Sound library. 
Main goal: Analyze the audio tracks of songs, focusing on extracting key characteristics 
such as: 


1.frequency
2.volume 

This foundational step will enable us to create an engaging music visualization in Java.

 We wanted it to draw images based on if its in the chorus, or the pre chorus. We wanted to do this by simply measuring the volume/ frequency of the song and draw images based on how loud and energetic the frequencies are.

 We ran into some trouble when we realised that some parts of the song in the beginning would randomly be loud and the system would pick that up. So we spent more time developing an algorithm that can pick up the frequency and the volume so it can be more accurate.

End result: We created an algorithm in the frequencyvol.java file to extract the volume without the frequency. It passed it's testing stages and aided us in moving towards creating a refined version that is more complex and accurate and extracts both the frequency and volume.


Week 2: (College Week8) 
 Using our audio analysis Week 1, we are set to develop visual elements designed to interact with the audio in real-time. Our approach is to embrace abstraction through visuals.

 Main goal: Create visuals that dynamically respond to music, aiming to visually represent
 
 1.Mood 
 2.Tempo
 3.Narrative

 Should result in an experience that tells a story and conveys emotions.

 Week 3: (College Week 9)
 This week focuses on using exciting visual version of the song.

Main goal: Use visuals to show the feelings, themes, and layout of the song, with a focus on:

1.Colour:Bright colours for happy parts and darker colours for sad or intense parts.

2.Shape: Different shapes to represent parts of the song. Sharp shapes for exciting parts, and smooth shapes for calm parts.

3.Motion: Make the visuals move in a way that follows the beat and rhythm of the song. Fast movements for fast parts of the song, and slow movements for the slow parts.

4.Composition: Arrange the visual elements in a way that shows the structure of the song, e.g using the layout to differentiate between the chorus and verses.

By doing this, we hope to make a visual story that goes along with the song.
